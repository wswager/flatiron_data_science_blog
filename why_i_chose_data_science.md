# Why I chose Data Science


_Why would I quit my job and take six-months off, driving myself crazy learning a completely new and foreign set of skills to pursue a new career I have zero familiarity with?_

## Introduction

In the following blog post I explore my personal motivations in changing career paths and enrolling in a bootcamp program to pursue data science.

Full disclosure, the [Data Science Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/campus-and-online-data-science-bootcamp/) I enrolled with[ Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=12728169839&utm_content=127574231184&utm_term=flatiron%20school&uqaid=513799628798&CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE) requires four blog post submissions as part of the curriculum.  This is the first of my posts, for phase one. I have chosen to do something slightly different in that I am writing exclusively non-technical blog posts.  So I will not be outlining the projects for each phase and my ‘process’ in completing them.  Besides, I am starting from zero, so, for the first project, I know nothing and it is so terrible (but hopefully I will get better).

## Why I Needed a Change


_‘I have a bad feeling about this’_



  _Han Solo_


### Some Background

I grew up playing soccer, rec-league with my friends through primary school, club soccer through middle and high school, varsity for my high school, then continued for my college team.  

My love of soccer prompted me toward two other threads my life:



*   After my final high school season, having been told I was too small to play in college, I started lifting weights
*   During high school, I began helping as an assistant coach for my younger brother’s club soccer team


### A Conversation with Dad

After my sophomore year of college, I was struggling to make a decision about what to pursue as a major.  Previously I had an interest in either environmental studies or political science, but, after actually trying some courses in those subjects, I was not sure the actual type of work was for me.  So, I had a conversation with my dad (_foreshadowing_), and he asked a simple question:

‘What do you care most about doing?’

I felt like it was a trick question.  At that point in my life, I felt like I was supposed to care about something that I could follow into a ‘real job.’  My peers were pursuing pre-law, pre-med, chemistry, business, etc.  

But I answered honestly, I cared most about playing soccer and working out.  

My dad’s reply: ‘Then find a way to major in those things.’

I honestly had not thought about it in that way.  But, I went online and looked to see if there was a way to major in ‘soccer’ and ‘working out.’  There is (_kind of_). 


### Following My Dream

I earned degrees in Sports Management and Exercise Science.

After college, I retained my optimism and tried paths towards dreams in soccer or fitness.  I had continued coaching youth club soccer throughout college, and, after college, earned jobs coaching high school varsity teams.  

I became a personal trainer and interned, and was eventually hired at a sports performance clinic, where I worked with high level athletes from high school, college, and occasionally pros.  

After a couple years, II was hired for an entry-level job with a professional women’s soccer team, in ticket-sales.


### Where I Got Lost

Money

Unfortunately, on the path to an actual career in either sports or fitness the ‘paying your dues’ period is long.  Both fields require a lot of experience in the positions which do not pay well in order to try to earn one of the very few ‘dream’ careers.

But I was newly married and feeling pressure to establish a career which supported us financially with benefits and savings; I was feeling pressure to be ‘responsible,’ and optimism was chipped away and replaced with realism.

So I took a job in customer service and stopped coaching because I no longer had time.  Over five-years, I was promoted to team lead, switched companies hoping for more opportunities to rise the ranks, and switched again and became an insurance agent.  And, while I hated it all along the way, it was the sensible path, it was supporting a sensible life, and was building for security long-term.

Then I got divorced.

The life I had been building for was gone.  And I found myself working remotely  from home during COVID, answering phones all day from people complaining about their insurance, and hating it, but now, I was not doing it for a reason.

I knew that I did not want a life of being unfulfilled and uninspired by my work; I wanted something I cared about.  But I did not know what that was.

### A Second Conversation with Dad

My dad is a consultant, primarily with computer and tech based business.  For a few years, he had encouraged me to begin learning to code and consider studying one of the fast growing fields in tech, like web developing, mobile developing, cyber security, or data science.  There was a lot of opportunity; businesses desperately wanted and needed those positions, but the fields were so new that very few people knew how to do them.

Initially I had been very resistant.  I had no background in coding, I had no particular interest in coding, I saw no connection between the career I was in and those fields, so I didn’t know how I could transition jobs, and it seemed really hard.

Then, I found myself needing a change; I did not have to continue in my sensible path that I hated anymore.  So, I began to explore the fields he had suggested.


### Why I Began to Count and Measure Everything

It is important to note, despite my playing career ending and taking a step away from coaching, my passion for soccer had not diminished during this period.  If anything, it has strengthened over time, and I had found myself diving deep into tactical analysis and learning about intricacies of the game that most normal fans do not care about.  And, in that exploration of the finer details of the game, I had begun to find more and more analysis of the data behind soccer and how teams were increasingly using statistics to identify players, tactics, and trends unseen by the naked eye.  And I loved it, I loved the systematic approach, I loved making the game a science, I loved uncovering non-traditional methods, and I genuinely enjoyed the teams that were most embracing these new practices.

Also, during this time, my passion for fitness had not diminished.  I had discovered [CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/), which seeks to train all aspects of fitness while transforming it into a sport.  So, again, statistics was entering into my passion.

Finally, despite how unhappy I generally was at work, there had been one project, in particular, which had stood out, really capturing  my interest and getting me really invested.  During my time as a team lead, the department I was working in was primarily tasked with order entry, taking orders from sales and inputting them into the system to then be fulfilled by manufacturing.  Management above me was very concerned with understanding the status of orders in-progress.  Sales, being sales, would talk-up their efforts and the big sales they were working on or about to complete, but the actual orders entered into the system were causing concern that the revenue goals for the quarter may not be met, everything in between was lost in a fog.  So, I created a shared spreadsheet where each individual member of my department could maintain their own list of in-progress orders, categorized by various stages of progress or hurdles preventing them from being entered.  The individual sheets would then feed into various shared sheets for different departments and management, which calculated percentages of orders in various categories, and potential revenue for each category.  This way management could have an idea of where things were, where things could be, and even get involved if and when necessary to help things along.


### And it Clicked

So my goal was to find a career where I could support a life I was happy with while being fulfilled and inspired at work.  And, I came to the realization:



1. I genuinely enjoyed projects which sought to organize and extract insight from numbers
2. My love of soccer and fitness had lead me to a genuine interest in statistics
3. One of the fields my dad had suggested I pursue involved a) and b)

_*Note - I need to credit my current fiance for pushing me over the edge.  After years of being told I had to be safe and sensible, I was too scared to let go of what I had and try something new.  She convinced me to take the leap, that we would be ok through it, and better after._

## Where is This Going?


_Exploring strange new worlds…_



  _James T. Kirk_

I have never been good at balance, I want to be all in, and I get overwhelmed juggling multiple things in life.  So, I left my job as an insurance agent  to enroll in a full-time bootcamp, diving in head-first, to learn as quickly as possible and start new.

At minimum, I feel like this path will be something that engages me, challenges me, and fits my personality in the type of work required.  I am a perfectionist, I like being organized, I like diving deep into the subjects I care about,  and I want to solve problems.  I feel like those are all traits that fit well with data science.

And I have a new, hopeful, path to an old dream.  Data Science is an emerging field in soccer.  Maybe I can find my way to the type of career I dreamed about when I was in college, just a little later, with a massive detour, and on a different road than I ever imagined taking me there.

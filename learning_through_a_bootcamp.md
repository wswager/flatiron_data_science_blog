# Learning Through a Bootcamp

_What worked and what did not for me_
***
# Introduction

In the following blog post I discuss what it was like for me learning data science through a bootcamp course.  I discuss my struggles with the pace, what study strategies I tried, which ones did or did not work for me, and what it was like completing a project.

_*Please Note - This is not a set of recommendations for how best to succeed in a bootcamp course and definitely does not fall in-line with the suggested strategies of the program or its instructors.  There are probably much better ways to do this._

Full disclosure, the [Data Science Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/campus-and-online-data-science-bootcamp/) I enrolled with[ Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=12728169839&utm_content=127574231184&utm_term=flatiron%20school&uqaid=513799628798&CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE) requires four blog post submissions as part of the curriculum.  This is the second of my posts, for phase two.

# Keeping Up

The first thing to address is the most obvious, but the easiest to underestimate.  The pace is very fast, the material is very dense, and there is a lot of it.

When the instructors and preparatory material warned me that this was a full time course requiring 40-hours per week, I assumed they were giving a worst case scenario and/or a strategy for maximum thoroughness.  

Those estimates did not oversell the situation.

The course moves extremely fast.  Typically, we cover one topic per day, sometimes two.  Each topic typically including ten-to-twenty lessons, and five-to-fifteen labs.  Each day we have a study group in which the instructor discusses the same topic as the previous day’s topics, so it is extremely beneficial to keep up with the topics.

We are given two-weeks for projects supposed to require one-week so that we can catch up on the material if we have fallen behind, and, so far, I have needed the entirety of the first week to catch-up, prior to working on the project, for each phase.

# M + A + T + H 

Initially, I really struggled with the lessons regarding the underlying math.  Half the challenge, for me, was learning and remembering the terminology.  At first, I was spending hours reading and re-reading the lessons trying to grasp the concepts in detail, and then not having enough time later to learn the code and do the labs.

Eventually  I realized, what I am really trying to accomplish is learning to write the code to accomplish specific tasks.  What I really needed to understand was what my code is doing, not always all the intricacies of how it was doing it.  If I need more detailed information later, I just need to know enough to find the necessary reference to help me.  I am not trying to get a career as a mathematician, I am trying to get a career in data science.

# Note or Not Note

Early in the class, I tried to take meticulous notes through both the lessons and the study groups, afraid of missing any key concepts and wanting to be sure to capture any important terminology and the details of every process.

This did not work.

The pace of the bootcamp and the density of the material meant that it was taking me far too long to take notes and I was not absorbing any of the materials because I was too focused on writing and moving too slowly for the concepts to connect in my mind.

More importantly, I started this bootcamp to find a topic I could get in to, care about, and become invested in.  When I care about a subject, I go all in on it, learning everything I can, looking up what I do not understand, filling in blanks from other resources, etc.  Taking meticulous notes was turning the subject into work and preventing me from getting invested and actually liking the subject.

Also, the material is not going anywhere.  So long as I generally understood the concepts, I could always return to it again later if I forgot or needed to reference.

Finally, the labs acted as a natural review of all the lessons, and were practical, actually implementing what I had just learned.  This is not college, I was not memorizing for a test, this is learning skills to actually do things in a job.

# Value of Materials v Lectures

As I said before, every day has a study group (read: lecture), covering the previous day’s topic (read: materials).  However, I found that the two were different, in a good way.

The study groups typically involve the instructor working through the same processes but with different examples than the lessons and labs live and with their own comments from personal experience and the real world worked in.  A lot of times this involved tips and tricks for how to best accomplish something outside of the technical documentation or official procession in the lessons and labs.

This also helped placing into perspective and prioritizing the subjects.  I found that when reading the lessons straight through, in can be easy to view everything the same.  This can lead to over-prioritizing certain pieces simply because they seemed more important within the smaller context or even just because they were difficult, and under-prioritizing things that may be the most important for the bigger picture (which I could not see yet).  The study groups and the instructor talking through how they personally do things, based on their actual experience in the field, can really help to understand the bigger process and what is actually important to the work I am striving to eventually do.

Finally, one of the most interesting and most valuable pieces to the study groups was, on occasion, seeing the instructor struggle with a piece or need to look something up.  _Please Note, this is in no way a criticism of the instructor’s knowledge or abilities, this is a positive._ In the real world, sometimes things do not work the way they are supposed to and no one can know everything.  What was valuable was seeing what resources the instructor used to look things up, their process for working through errors, and the trial and error process that is an essential piece to this type of work.  And that does not come from the lessons and labs.

One note on the pace of the course v the value of the study groups.  At first, I felt it a little overwhelming to try to rush to keep up with the materials because I did not want to miss the study group or not understand what was being discussed.  However, the study groups were all recorded and posted on YouTube, and, once I was able to set aside my stubbornness and pride, I found that sometimes I needed to accept that I needed to go my own pace, but I could still get the value out of the study groups when I was ready.

# The Answer Exists

When it came to the projects, it became more like a constant set of hurdles toward the eventual goal.

For me, working through the projects has typically been, a series of trying to accomplish tasks that, while I have done them before in strictly controlled processes of labs, now I am attempting in ways and/or combinations so different that they are unrecognizable.  Sometimes, I can review the lessons and labs to remember what the next step is, find the correct formatting of the piece of code, or correct my syntax.  However, oftentimes I ended up either completely unsure of how to do what I knew needed to be done next, or struggling with constant error messages and unable to find the mistake.

This is where searching online became the main learning tool.  The lessons, labs, and study groups gave me the basic understanding and tools, but when it came time to actually put it together and implement it in projects, I needed help, and the internet (mostly) was there for me.

The obvious resources are [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), or usually just Googling questions, terminology, error messages, or pieces of code.  And not everything was reliable or applicable to my situation (or best practice, be careful to check that with solutions from the internet whenever possible).  But the answer was usually out there, and, I found, that if I looked, and usually compared a few sources for what I was looking for, after a little trial and error (and maybe looking up why the solution I received for the first issue was now causing its own issue), I could Frankenstein together something that actually worked the way I wanted it to.

# Getting Help for the Antisocial

I am very antisocial.

The course, while online, offered a lot of resources for socialization, and, while I appreciate them and understand their value, they just were not for me.  

We had a Slack Channel for all students, which some used to post their questions or struggles, but this was overwhelming for me to try to keep up with and participate in, and I am more comfortable trying to look things up my own.  

We also had Office Hours almost every day, in which we could ask questions, however, I mainly enjoyed when the instructor would use these to demonstrate a process or topic not specifically addressed in the materials as some additional real world context.

However, something that I learned too late was that one-on-ones became an invaluable resource for help.  At first I was really resistant to scheduling one-on-ones because I was worried I would be asked to discuss material I was struggling to understand and would feel exposed for not knowing what I should.  I also felt uncomfortable asking questions because I was often behind and did not want to reveal it.

I was wrong.

The instructors did not care about any of that.  They were not there to judge me, but genuinely just wanted to help me understand or help fix a problem.

Also, one-on-ones acted as a perfect balance v looking up solutions online.  While the online solutions were instant access and I could work through them on my own, sometimes they didn’t fit with the specifics of what I was doing or were not the best practice and had down-sides I was unaware of.  Scheduling regular one-on-ones helped me to correct issues before they could domino or catch errors before I had to submit my work.  It also helped a lot with understanding the whys in the process v just the hows I could find online and pull everything together conceptually.

# Trial and Error

One of the main things I learned about data science was that the process is trial and error, both in the scientific approach and, often, just in making the process work with the coding.

Getting through the bootcamp style course was also trial and error, trying different methods of learning, pacing, getting help, etc. and seeing what worked for me to eventually produce the results.  And I imagine jobs in the field will be much of the same.

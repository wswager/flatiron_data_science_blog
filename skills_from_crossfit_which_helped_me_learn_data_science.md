# Introduction

In the following blog post I discuss the lessons I have learned from [CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/), which have helped me in my studying of data science.  

In a previous blogpost, [Why I Chose Data Science](https://github.com/wswager/flatiron_data_science_blog/blob/main/why_i_chose_data_science.md), mentioned that my love of fitness lead me to find CrossFit, and CrossFit helped me develop an appreciation for statistics which was a part of why I felt data science would be a good career path for me.

CrossFit is a form of fitness training which seeks to develop and combine all aspects of fitness and train and compete like a sport.

Full disclosure, the [Data Science Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/campus-and-online-data-science-bootcamp/) I enrolled with[ Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=12728169839&utm_content=127574231184&utm_term=flatiron%20school&uqaid=513799628798&CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAjwiLGGBhAqEiwAgq3q_nzPYrEWzpEpuwBOgdki5zv1VCYeHFflfmTr8NnOLN-Tp9DoyNntwxoCnj0QAvD_BwE) requires four blog post submissions as part of the curriculum.  This is the second of my posts, for phase two.

# Interdisciplinary Approach

The goal of CrossFit is to develop all aspects of fitness together, strength, speed, power, agility, balance, quickness, endurance, etc.  CrossFit will focus equally on performing olympic lifts, such as a clean and jerk, performing gymnastic movements, like a handstand-walk, performing bodyweight movements like a sit-up, testing the endurance like a one-mile run, or any other test of fitness, many times in-combinations.  CrossFit is a combination of the many different individual aspects of fitness.

Data science similarly is interdisciplinary, requiring a combination of skills in coding, statistics, and subject knowledge, with many different and important smaller subsets and skills between.

In CrossFit it is common to be better at one or a few pieces than others, but you cannot succeed as a specialist, you have to be well-rounded.  Data Science is the same, a weakness in any of the areas.  Being an expert in the math will not help in relaying actionable recommendations for what to do with the results.  Being and expert coder will not help in understanding the algorithms and how to process data to produce results.  Being an expert in the subject will not help knowing how to write and understand code.

What is most important is being well-rounded and capable in all areas.

# Focus on the Fundamentals

In CrossFit, brute force and effort can get you far, but there is a ceiling, and the cost of error can be catastrophic.  If you are strong and you do a lot of reps over time, you can develop a heavy [snatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xQp2sldyts), but, if you do not learn the correct technique early and practice and reinforce it along the way, you will plateau, and others, potentially less strong, but with better technique, will become better.  Also, if you do not learn the correct technique, the risk of injury grows significantly.

In data science, I have learned to focus on the fundamentals of each piece rather than just driving toward the end goal.  If I do not properly clean my data along the process, I have have confusing results or outliers disrupting it.  If I do not use the correct preprocessing techniques, I may have data leakage or disrupt my formatting and be unable to correctly interpret later.  If I do not properly hyper tune my parameters for my models, then the efficacy of my eventual findings will be limited.

# Constantly Varying

One of the core components of the CrossFit methodology is to constantly vary, every workout is different movements in different combinations, rep-counts, time-intervals, etc.  This forces constant adaptation and improvement, as well as, reinforces the concept of well-roundedness.

In data science, while there are some standardized practices, pieces of coding and functions that are reused, just as you would use the same proper technique for each movement in CrossFit, each individual problem or project is unique, just as each workout in CrossFit is different.  Each data set is unique and each business problem is unique and therefore the process of the project should be treated accordingly, which requires a familiarity and capability with all potential processes required.

# Being Scalable

One of the most intimidating factors about CrossFit for many is the perception of the difficulty and expertise required.  People see the athletes that compete at the [CrossFit Games](https://games.crossfit.com/) and think that is what is required.  However, one of the main foundations of CrossFit is the concept of scaling.  Every athlete who participates in CrossFit is encouraged to scale-down workouts to within the realm of their abilities in order to achieve the intended stimulus and improve.  If the workout is written as prescribed (Rx) with handstand push-ups, if an athlete cannot complete that movement, they can scale to push-ups, or pushups from the knees, etc.  Beyond that, scaling is not just based on pure ability, but the intent of the workout.  If a workout is intended for an athlete to complete at least three-rounds of a workout in ten-minutes, and part of each round is twenty-repetitions of a 135lbs front-squat, and an athlete can front-squat 135lbs, but only 2-3 reps at a time and requires 2-3minutes between, then they should scale to maintain the intent of the workout.

In learning data science, I have found that it is important to scale to my abilities so that I can best learn the process and become better.  While learning how to solve a classification problem, I found ready-made data in manageable size and formats, rather than scraping custom data.  The intent was to learn the process of preprocessing the data, fitting models, and making predictions, not spending the majority of my time extracting, exploring, and cleaning data.  And, similarly, even if I was capable, it was would have misplaced the emphasis, as it was not the intention of the project.  I scaled to my current abilities in order to achieve the intended stimulus and improve.

I imagine this to be try in the field as well.  If the business problem is to predict churn amongst telecommunications customers given a specific set of data provided by the company, and under a short deadline, it is probably best to remain within parameters, using the most straight-forward data and basic modeling techniques to produce a minimum viable product, and then improve with any remaining time.  If you were to spend half the time provided engineering complex features and not have time to adequately tune your models, then you are not fulfilling the intention of the projects and will probably have poor results.

However, scaling goes both directions.  In CrossFit, you also want to be challenging yourself to constantly improve, and therefore, over-scaling and not achieving the intended stimulus is also discouraged.  In data science, the approach of the course has been to progressively increase the difficulty and, one of the practices taught for presenting in the field is to always develop a set of ‘next steps’, constantly establishing ways to be better and improve going forward.

# How to Suck at Things

Most of all, CrossFit has taught me how to be bad at things and that is ok.  

Because of how broad CrossFit is, there will always be a lot of room to improve and you will never be the best at anything.  So CrossFit taught me how to accept feeling bad at things but to feel achievement in constantly improving.

Data science is an iterative process, with trial and error, failing and finding a solution, constantly trying to improve.  Real perfection is unattainable as no prediction will ever be completely accurate, but we strive to get as accurate as possible toward the goal.
